            <h2> Data File Formatting Guide:</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Header Formatting</h3>
            <br>
            Data should be stored in a .txt file. <br>
            The first line of the .txt file should be a string identifying the name of your sequence.<br>
            The second line of the .txt file should be the timestep used for your simulation. (in milliseconds)<br>
            Your simulation data should begin on the third line.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>Data Formatting</h3>
            <br>
            The data section of the .txt file is occupied by chunks of data representing the change in magnetization vectors over time for various spins. 
            Demarkate the beginning of a specific spin's data with the break character "|" on a new line. After this break character, each line in the text file should be occupied with a single Vector3 indicating the state of the current vector at a specific timepoint. Vectors should occupy the range from 0 to 1 and should be encoded as floating points with 6 decimals of precision in the following format, including parenthesis:<br>
            <di style="text-align:center">(x.xxxxxx, y.yyyyyy, z.zzzzzz)</div>
            <br>
            <h3>Sample Data File</h3>
            The following is a sample data file with three spins that don't change over time. Each points along a different axis.<br>
